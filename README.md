What is RunThisApp?
-------------------

RunThisApp is a website which provide to developer set of tools to distribute iOS applications Over-The-Air for your testers.

When the website is configure on a server, difference developers can work on the same platform and can:

- Add testers just by giving their name and email
- Upload an application that you want to test
- Send invite to testers to make them register their devices and install the app

When you send an invite to a tester, the system retrieve the tester device UDID, resign you app with the tester information  and sent back a new mail with download application info to the tester.

Run This App is a web project written in PHP ([RunThisApp website][1]).

Requirements
------------

RunThisApp is only supported on PHP 5.3.0 and up.

Installation
------------

1. The best way to install RunThisApp is to download it from [our Github repository][2].

2. Then you have to configure git submodules by executing the following commands in your git directory:
    
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

3. RunThisApp use [Doctrine][3] (an Object relational mapper for PHP) and an SQLite database. To initialize this database, in the core subfolder, you have to execute:
    
    ./doctrine orm:schema-tool:create
	
4. For sending emails to testers and accessing your Apple Developer account, you have to fill the file credential.php:
    
    <?php
        $CRED_USR = '__your_user__';
        $CRED_PWD = '__your_passwd__';
        
        $CRED_SMTP = 'smtp.gmail.com';		// example
        $CRED_SMTP_PORT = 465;				// example
        $CRED_SMTP_USR = '__your_email__';
        $CRED_SMTP_PWD = '__your_passwd__';
    ?>

5. Last step is to set the permissions to allow the server to write some folder. The following folders needs to be writable (chmod ugo+rwx __file__):

For the SQLitedatabase and Doctrine:

- /core/
- /core/database.sqlite
- /core/Proxies/

For app upload:

- /app/

NOTE: For application uploading, you may have to change the max upload file size in php.ini (the key is named "upload_max_filesize")

KNOWN ISSUES: The folder containing your website can't be named "back"
